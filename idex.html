    <h1>IDNA Support in Python - idna Library</h1>
    <p>This library provides support for the Internationalized Domain Names in Applications (IDNA) protocol as specified in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5891">RFC 5891</a>, which is the latest version of the protocol and is sometimes referred to as “IDNA 2008”.</p>

    <h2>Additional Notes</h2>
    <p>Packages. The latest tagged release version is published in the Python Package Index.</p>
    <p>Version support. This library supports Python 3.6 and higher.</p>
    <p>Python 2. Python 2 is supported by version 2.x of this library. Use “idna&lt;3” in your requirements file if you need this library for a Python 2 application.</p>
    <p>Testing. The library has a test suite based on each rule of the IDNA specification, as well as tests that are provided as part of the Unicode Technical Standard 46, Unicode IDNA Compatibility Processing.</p>
    <p>Emoji. It is an occasional request to support emoji domains in this library. Encoding of symbols like emoji is expressly prohibited by the technical standard IDNA 2008 and emoji domains are broadly phased out across the domain industry due to associated security risks.</p>
